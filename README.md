> Super awesome web based podcast manager and audio/video player. I used Symfony2 and Doctrine along with
third party modules like SimplePie and and custom modules. For the front end I used Angular, Less and Bootstrap to
create an intuitive user interface. The project uses Grunt to automate builds and for package management
I use Bower/NPM and Composer.
